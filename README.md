Welcome to Calculator!

Firstly, you'll have to CD into the /calculator folder because npx create-react-app created a new folder inside the folder I already built. Whoops.

Once there, you can follow that auto-generated README to start using the app, or you can just npm install and then npm start to get going.

There are no tests. Please don't npm test; it'll be dissapointing.

This project contains a calculator that allows you to multiply, divide, add, and subtract. It should live update your result as you progress.

Limitations:

- The decimal functionality works but is a little wonky. There probably should be a special case for the period.
- The number you are writing can go past the screen edges. Avoid very long numbers.
- Writing two operations back-to-back will overwrite the first operation. I suppose this behavior is undefined, but on other calculators if you, say, do a \*=, you'll get a square.

Enjoy -- math is fun!
